<p>I am a junior at Georgetown University in Washington, DC, majoring in Economics and German with a minor in Mathematics. I am a big fan of functional programming languages such as Haskell, Idris and Coq. Aside from programming, I am interested in advanced mathematical topics such as abstract algebra and topology. Finally, I am interested in applying math and programming to topics in economics such as public finance.</p>

<p>Eventually there will be blog posts in the <a href="/archive.html">archives</a>!</p>
