<p>I am a junior at Georgetown University in Washington, DC, majoring in Economics and German with a minor in Computer Science. I am a big fan of functional programming languages such as Haskell, Idris and OCaml. I can also code with a basic level of proficiency in C++. Aside from proramming, I am interested in advanced mathematical topics such as abstract algebra and topology.</p>

<p>There isn't much going on here yet, sadly:</p>
