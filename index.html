I am a junior at Georgetown University in Washington, DC, majoring in Mathematics and German with a minor in Economics. I plan on graduating early after the Fall 2017 semester. I am a big fan of functional programming languages such as Haskell, Idris and Coq. I have an <a href="https://github.com/hzelenka">active GitHub account</a> that even hosts <a href="https://github.com/hzelenka/hzelenka.github.io">the source code for this site</a>! Aside from programming, I am interested in advanced mathematical topics, in particular abstract algebra and category theory.</p>
